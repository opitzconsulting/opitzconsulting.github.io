# opitzconsulting blog

Experimental blogging solution for our employees at OPITZ CONSULTING.
Visit our blog and see the results at http://opitzconsulting.github.io/.

## TODOs

* Categories (lets stick our heads together and find the right categories)
* Site Layout
  * Timeline (see bootflat for great example)
  * Design (responsive, baby!)
* Multiple Authors of a Post (maybe... do we really have this case? yagni!)
* Blog Post Migration from old blog (what to automate?)
* Search (json metafile + angular way)
